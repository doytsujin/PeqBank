## Architecture :triangular_ruler:

`PeqBank` is a C-library designed to perform parametric equalization using analog-like parametric EQs. This implementation was documented in [Musical Applications of New Filter Extensions to Max/MSP](http://web.media.mit.edu/~tristan/Papers/ICMC99_MaxFilters.pdf).

## Usage example :eyes:

[`main.c`](source/main.c) provides an example program.

The following explains how to setup a low pass filter:

```c
#include "peqbank.h"

/* Assume arrays signal_in and signal_out and values
   num_frames, buffer_size and num_channels are declared
  $a. somewhere else
*/
t_filter **filters = new_filters(1);  // init number of desired filters
filters[0] = new_lowpass(4000, 1, 6);  // attach lowpass filter
peqbank_setup(x, filters);             // setup filters
for (int i = 0; i < num_frames; i += buffer_size) {
  if (num_frames - i < buffer_size) x->s_n = num_frames - i;
  frame += peqbank_callback_int16(
      x, &signal_in[frame * num_channels], &signal_out[frame * num_channels]);
}
x->s_n = buffer_size;  // reset buffer size...
free(filters[0]);
```

It is important to note that the peq filter bank must be allocated and free'd manually.
There is no RAII support as it is currently meant to be C-compatible.

## Installation :inbox_tray:

`PeqBank` is a [Cmake](https://cmake.org/) project. While you are free to download the prebuilt static libraries it is recommended to use Cmake to install this project into your wider project. In order to add this into a wider Cmake project, add the following line to your `CMakeLists.txt` file:
```
add_subdirectory(PeqBank)
```

Each script in [`ci/`](./ci) demonstrates how to build and the dependencies required per platform, although they do not account for integration into other build systems, like Gradle.

## Development

Generally the process is:

```sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -GXcode # or Ninja
$ open PeqBank.xcodeproj # MacOS Only
```

Check ths scripts in [`ci/`](./ci) for more platform-specific details.
